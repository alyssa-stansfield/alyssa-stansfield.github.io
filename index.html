            <h3>Alyssa M. Stansfield, PhD</h3>
            <p>
		Alyssa is currently an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204138&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellow</a> at Colorado State University working with <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/rasmussen/">Dr. Kristen Rasmussen</a>. She graduated with her PhD in Atmospheric Science from Stony Brook University in May 2022 and with a BS in Meteorology from Rutgers University in May 2017. Her main postdoctoral project focuses on understanding how the 3D precipitation structures in tropical cyclones may change due to climate change.

            <h3>Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of the deadliest storm systems on Earth. One focus of my research is understanding how TCs fit into the climate system as a whole and how their characteristics are influenced by climate change. Recently I have used high-resolution model simulations to understand how climate warming affects the distribution of precipitation between the TCs' inner cores and outer rainbands.

            <h3>Modeling Across Scales</h3>
            <p>Research at the climate-weather interface requires models that can connect these scales. In my research, I use models ranging from global climate models run with ~100 km grid spacing to simulations of individual weather events with grid spacing of ~1 km, as well as variable-resolution global models. These models across scales, in addition to idealized models, faciliate a more complete understanding of the relationship between climate and weather.

            <h3>Precipitation Processes</h3>
            <p> My research approaches studying precipitation through the different storm sytems that produce it, such as tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective systems, atmospheric rivers, and extratropical storms. I use atmospheric models and observations from satellites, radars, and precipitation gauges to study storms and their precipitation, focusing on understanding why some storms produce extreme precipitation while others don't and how these storms and the resulting precipitation are impacted by natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change.
