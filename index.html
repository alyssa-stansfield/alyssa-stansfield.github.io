	<p align="left" >I'm currently an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204138&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellow</a> at Colorado State University working with <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/rasmussen/">Dr. Kristen Rasmussen</a>. My project focuses on understanding how the 3D precipitation structures of tropical cyclones may change due to climate change. My general research interests include tropical cyclones and other extreme weather, climate change and variability, and climate model assessment.</p>
