	<p align="left" >I'm currently an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204138&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellow</a> at Colorado State University working with <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/rasmussen/">Dr. Kristen Rasmussen</a>. I graduated with my PhD in Atmospheric Science from Stony Brook University in May 2022 and with a BS in Meteorology from Rutgers University in May 2017. My main postdoctoral project focuses on understanding how the 3D precipitation structures in tropical cyclones may change due to climate change. My other research interests include extreme precipitation and flooding, climate change and variability, and climate model assessment.</p>
