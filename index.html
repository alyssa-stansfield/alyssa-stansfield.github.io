	<p>I'm currently a postdoc at Stony Brook University working with Dr. Kevin Reed in the <a href="https://you.stonybrook.edu/kareed/">Climate Extremes Modeling Group</a>. In the Fall, I'll be starting as an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204138&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF AGS Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at Colorado State University with <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/rasmussen/">Dr. Kristen Rasmussen</a>. My research interests include tropical cyclones and other extreme weather, climate change and variability, and climate model assessment.</p>
