<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
<p>In Spring 2022 during my last semester of grad school at Stony Brook University, I was the main instructor for an introductory undergraduate course called "Prospects for Planet Earth". This course had just over 100 undergraduates from a variety of majors enrolled and covered topics including pollution, climate change, and resource management. I added additional content about the politicization of climate change, communicating about environmental issues, and more. I also created a final project where the students had to choose a solution to an environmental problem like climate change or pollution and write a report about it at the end of the course. <a href="/assets/ENS101_syllabus.pdf">Click here to see the syllabus of the course when I taught it.</a>  In addition, I have guest lectured for both undergraduate and graduate courses at Stony Brook and Colorado State. I have continued to improve my teaching through CSU's "Best Practices in Teaching" online courses.</p>

<h2>Mentoring Experience</h2>
<p>During my time in grad school and as a postdoc, I have mentored undergraduate students in various capacities. Currently I am a mentor for the <a href="https://gems-program.org/">Geosciences Education & Mentoring Support Program</a>, which helps undergraduates who are applying to grad school. I also mentored multiple undergrads alongside my PhD advisor in completing research projects, and two of those undergrads have published first-author peer-reviewed manuscripts on their research. At Stony Brook, I was a mentor for 3 years for the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program. During the Fall 2022 semester, I taught an unofficial course for undergrads in my department at Stony Brook about applying to grad school. The goal of this course was to help undergrads decide if they wanted to go to grad school and learn about the application process, including the "hidden curriculum". The course included a panel event with current grad students and professors, lectures on the application process, and examples of application documents.
